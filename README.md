# Peaceful Nights

Adds the game rule "doSurfaceSpawning" which is `false` by default.

When disabled mob spawning behaves as if it was always day.
No mobs will spawn on the surface at night and during thunderstorms.

This only affects dimensions that have sky light, so the overworld, but not the nether or the end.

This also does **not** affect slime spawning in swamps.
